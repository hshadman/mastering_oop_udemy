I took a course a Udemy to learn object-oriented programming in Python.
This is the course: https://www.udemy.com/course/python-oop-course/ 
Here, in this reposotory, my practice work as well as homework problems and capstone project are stored.

i am expanding my understanding of the Python programming language by exploring object-oriented programming with Python, so that i can use it for my research projects.
